Thank You,

Dear Meriem, Aram, and Cem,

First, I want to sincerely thank you for the time and energy you gave me during our meeting. I deeply value the opportunity to learn from you and to be challenged by you.

As part of this journey, I would like to put forward a request — to not only be interviewed, but also to be challenged:



To Meriem Jirari: I request you to bring me a challenge around upskilling employees  both technically and emotionally. Especially during these times of growing metal health and job loss fear.→ *My goal is to come up with a unique upskilling plan to save talent loss.

To Aram Smith: I request you to give me the most difficult challenge of the AI Innovation at Microsoft.→ My goal is to find unique, out-of-the-box ways to solve it.

To Cem Kubilay: I request you to ask me to design a personalized Agentic AI app that empowers top executives to stay productive.→ My goal is to develop a protoype of AI Agentic app that is used daily by CTO.

Else: I also challenge myself to imagine new Microsoft apps for the future, along with new features for existing apps that can create more value for users.

For me, its about solving real problems with a unique disruptive approach.

With Warm Gratitude,Sameer
